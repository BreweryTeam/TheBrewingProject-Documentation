title: "BreweryX vs TheBrewingProject"
---

### At a glance
BreweryX is more tested, as it's a 10-year-old project, but its rewrite, TBP, has much cleaner code, more advanced features and maintenance priority

### Differences
- TBP supports custom multiblock structures as distilleries where BreweryX only allowed regular brewing stands to be used.
- TBP doesn't copy every small feature from BreweryX to reduce the feature bloat, but if you need a specific thing, reach out to us, and we will consider it
- TBP's brew creation is a bit less forgiving (customizable) so, on default settings, you can no longer make a beer with an entire stack of wheat if all other steps are ok
- While the time it takes to distill something is specified per recipe in BreweryX, in TBP, this is specified per distillery, so you can have faster and slower distilleries
- BreweryX encrypts its data the will-deter-average-people way, while TBP encrypts its data the don't-even-try-to-decrypt-that way and supports easy encryption-key rotation

### New features in TBP
- The distillery is now its own multiblock structure, made up of three decorated pots and three bamboo fences
- You may define your own custom multiblock structures to be used as barrels or distilleries, by using schematics
- An event system allows fine-tuning what drinks cause what after effects + you may create your own custom events
- You can introduce your own modifiers instead of- or in addition to alcohol, toxins and alcohol-addiction/tolerance
- The order of steps in a recipe is not pre-defined, so you could do `distill->age->cook->cook->age->distill` for example
- You can freely choose the output material of a potion, so a haste potion can look like a diamond pickaxe if you wish
- A new `mix` step that is basically the same as `cook`, but without a heat source underneath the cauldron
- The `cook` and `mix` steps can require a specific substance in the cauldron (water/lava/snow)
