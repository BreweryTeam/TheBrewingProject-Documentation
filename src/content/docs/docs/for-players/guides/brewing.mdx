In The Brewing Project, a brew can created by processing it through different structures.

To succesfully complete a brew, it has to have followed the right steps, such that it is close enough to one of the many recipes created by the server's administration, **that's why the recipes usually differ from server to server!**

<Aside title="Boiling/mixing/fermenting/cooking | pot/boiler/cauldron/cooker" variant="info">

There are a lot of different terms used in the Brewery community to describe processing of the ingredients, and the structure used to do so.

This isn't a huge problem in BreweryX, but TBP introduced mixing and cooking as separate processes, which can be confusing.

This guide will use the following terms:

- Cooking: The process of putting ingredients into a boiler with a heat source.
- Mixing: The process of putting ingredients into a boiler without a heat source.
- Boiler: The structure used to cook or mix ingredients. (cauldron with water)

The inital step when brewing is always going to be to cook/mix the ingredients in a boiler.

## Cooking/Mixing ingredients

To cook or mix ingredients, you first need to create a boiler. A boiler is created by simply putting your ingredients into a cauldron with water (by right-clicking).  
Most recipes will also require a heat source (like a campfire, magma block, or fire) placed directly underneath the boiler.

As soon as the ingredients are in the boiler, it will start processing them. While it does that, you should see particles appearing above the cauldron *(tip: the particles will change color depending on how close are you to a defined recipe or the progress of making the brew)*.

You can check for how long has the boiler been processing the ingredients by right-clicking it with a clock.

You might wonder how long it takes for the ingredients to be processed. The time, the amount of ingredients and the ingredients themselves, depend on the recipe. There is no true answer to this question, so you'll just have to experiment :D
