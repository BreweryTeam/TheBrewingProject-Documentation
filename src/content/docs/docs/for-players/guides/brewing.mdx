In The Brewing Project, a brew can created by processing it through different structures.

To successfully complete a brew, it has to have followed the right steps, such that it is close enough to one of the many recipes created by the server's administration, **that's why the recipes usually differ from server to server!**

The initial step when brewing is always going to be to cook/mix the ingredients in a boiler.

## Cooking/Mixing ingredients

The first step depends on whether you want to cook or mix.

For cooking, you must first place a heat source (like a campfire, magma block or just a fire) underneath your cauldron. For mixing, you don't need any heat at all.

Once your setup is ready, simply add water to the cauldron, and right-click it while holding an ingredient to add it.

Once the ingredients are in the boiler, cooking or mixing will begin. While it does that, you should see particles appearing above the cauldron *(tip: the particles will change color depending on how close you are to a defined recipe or the progress of making your brew)*.

You can check how long the boiler has been processing the ingredients by right-clicking it with a clock.

So, how long does it take and what ingredients should you use? That depends entirely on the server's recipes, and discovering that for yourself is the whole point of TBP, so you just have to experiment :D
