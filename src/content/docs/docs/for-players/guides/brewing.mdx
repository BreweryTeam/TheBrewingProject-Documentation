In The Brewing Project, a brew can created by processing it through a multiple different structures. To succesfully complete a brew, it has to have followed the right processing steps, such that it is close enough to one of the many templates unique to the server.

The inital step when brewing is always going to be to boil/ferment the ingredients (see the "Creating a Boiler section"). After that you can distill or age the drink, which is completely recipe dependant. Note that all processes are either time dependant or cycle dependant.

## Boiling/Fermenting/mixing ingredients

You simply need to right click a cauldron with a valid ingredient in hand, and it will be added to the ingredients. The ingredients needs to be boiled/fermented/mixed for a while depending on the recipe, keep track of the time!

Note that a recipe outcome will be different depending on whether the cauldron is heated or not!

## Aging a drink

After putting the drink into the barrel, it will start aging. This process is very slow, and the time can vary depending on the recipe. You can build both small and large barrels, as in BreweryX. Note that a large barrel requires legs, and a small barrel is 2x2x3 in dimension instead.

## Distilling a drink

A distillery has two inventories, one for the output (distillate) and another for the input (mixture). Simply put the brew in the mixture inventory and wait a while. After about a minute, the brew will be distilled, and can be retrieved from the distillate inventory. The amount of times a brew needs to be distilled depends on the recipe.
