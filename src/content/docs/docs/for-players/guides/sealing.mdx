Sealing your brews hides the brewing steps from the lore, making it harder other players to replicate your recipes. Which allows you to establish a brewing monopoly, letting you charge a fortune for your brews.

You can also brand your brews, which will add a custom name to the brew lore.

## How to Seal

It's pretty simple, just:

- Hold the brew you want to seal in your main hand.
- Hold paper in your offhand.
- Right click on a crafting table while sneaking.

The brew will be sealed, and the paper will be consumed.

### How to Brand

Branding works the same way as sealing, but you just need to name the paper first (e.g. using an anvil).
