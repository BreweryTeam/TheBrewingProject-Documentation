Sealing your brewing process protects your recipes from other players. This allows you to establish a brewing monopoly, letting you charge a fortune for your brews.

You can also brand your brews, which will add a line to the lore of the brew.

## How to Seal

It's pretty simple, just:

- Hold a brew in your main hand.
- Hold paper in your offhand.
- Shift right click on a crafting table.
- The brew will be sealed, and the paper will be consumed.

### How to Brand

The instructions are the same as sealing, but you just need to rename the paper (using an anvil for example).
