## Introduction

TBP allows you to define custom effects that are applied to players when they consume brews.  
To add effects to your brews, you need to configure them in the `effects` section of a brew's recipe (in the `recipes.yml` file).

## Effect Configuration

Each effect is defined by its type, duration, amplifier. They can also be configured to apply conditionally based on the brew's quality.

### Format

Effects are defined using the following format:
```yaml
effects:
    - <EFFECT_TYPE>/<AMPLIFIER>/<DURATION>
```
- `EFFECT_TYPE`: The type of effect to apply (e.g., `SPEED`, `POISON`, `REGENERATION`). You can find a list of all available effect types in the [PaperMC's Javadocs](https://jd.papermc.io/paper/1.21.10/org/bukkit/potion/PotionEffectType.html).
- `AMPLIFIER`: The strength of the effect (0 for level I, 1 for level II, etc.).
- `DURATION`: The duration of the effect in seconds.

#### Ranges

You can also specify ranges for the amplifier and duration to introduce variability in the effects. Use the following format:

```yaml
effects:
    - <EFFECT_TYPE>/<AMPLIFIER_MIN>-<AMPLIFIER_MAX>/<DURATION_MIN>-<DURATION_MAX>
```
A random value within the specified range will be chosen each time the effect is applied.

If you're coming from BreweryX, you may remember that the ranges were used for specifying different values based on brew quality.

In TBP, this is no longer the case. Instead, you can define quality-specific effects using the new format described below.

#### Quality Factored Effects

You can define effects that apply only to specific brew qualities by prefixing the effect definition with `+++`, `++`, or `+`.  
This format is described more in detail in the [Quality Factored List](/docs/for-server-owners/reference/basics/#quality-factored-list) section of the Basics page.

```yaml
effects:
    - +++<EFFECT_TYPE>/<AMPLIFIER>/<DURATION> # Excellent only
    - ++<EFFECT_TYPE>/<AMPLIFIER>/<DURATION>  # Good only
    - +<EFFECT_TYPE>/<AMPLIFIER>/<DURATION>   # Bad only
    - <EFFECT_TYPE>/<AMPLIFIER>/<DURATION>    # All qualities
```

## Examples

### Simple Example

A brew that gives a Speed II effect for 45 to 90 seconds:
```yaml
effects:
    - SPEED/1/45-90
```

### A more complex example

Let's say we want to add:
- A strong poison effect for Bad quality brews, and a weak poison effect for Good quality brews. No poison effect for Excellent quality brews.
- A speed boost that increases in strength with the quality of the brew.
- Regeneration and absorption only for Excellent quality brews.
- A nausea effect for all qualities.

```yaml
effects:
    - +POISON/2/30-60        # Bad only: Poison III for 30-60 seconds
    - ++POISON/1/20-40       # Good only: Poison II for 20-40 seconds
    - +++SPEED/2/60-120      # Excellent only: Speed III for 60-120 seconds
    - ++SPEED/1/45-90        # Good only: Speed II for 45-90 seconds
    - +SPEED/0/30-60         # Bad only: Speed I for 30-60 seconds
    - +++REGENERATION/1/15-30 # Excellent only: Regeneration II for 15-30 seconds
    - +++ABSORPTION/1/60     # Excellent only: Absorption II for 60 seconds
    - NAUSEA/0/20-40         # All qualities: Nausea I for 20-40 seconds
```
