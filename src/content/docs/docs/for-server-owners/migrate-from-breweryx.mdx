# Migration from BreweryX

You can now migrate from BreweryX, this is how it's done:

- Obtain [this](https://ci.breweryteam.dev/job/BreweryTeam/job/TheBrewingProject/job/master/18/artifact/migration/build/libs/TheBrewingProjectMigration-2.0.0-beta.0-master-52fc05.jar) migration plugin file
- Add that plugin including TheBrewingProject 2.0.0 into your `/plugins` folder
- Leave the latest BreweryX plugin version available in the `/plugins` folder (IMPORTANT)
- You can now run your server
- After the server has started, stop the server and remove both BreweryX and the migration plugin

### What will be migrated?

- Barrels and only brew contents inside barrels (This will not apply to Minecraft barrels), any non brews will be wiped from existence
- Cauldrons with their brew progress and ingredients
- Everything in the `recipes.yml` file, except for:
  - Most ingredient defined in `custom-items.yml`
  - Other brews as ingredients might also break, as the brew display name can no longer be used as a key. 

Direct command definitions for recipes are no longer possible in TheBrewingProject, these will automatically be migrated over to event definitions, see `events.yml`

### What will not be migrated?

Everything not listed in the above section will not be migrated, this includes:
- Brews in other locations than barrels. **The data format is completely different for brews, they can not be read without the BreweryX API!**
- `config.yml`
- `custom-items.yml`
- `cauldron.yml`
