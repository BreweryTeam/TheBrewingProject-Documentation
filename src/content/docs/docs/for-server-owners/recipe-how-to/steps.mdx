## Introduction

By defining a sequence of steps in a recipe, you will specify how a perfect brew has to be made. The real brewing process does not necessarily need to match exactly with the defined recipe steps.

There are 4 different steps that are currently supported by TheBrewingProject:
- Cooking
- Mixing
- Distilling
- Aging

<Aside title="Initial Step">
Cooking and distilling always have to be the first step of any brewing process!
</Aside>

## Step Format
Each type of step has an unique format

### Cooking step
An example definition of a cooking step:
```yml
- type: cook
  cook-time: 2min
  cauldron-type: water
  ingredients:
    - apple/10
    - my_plugin_name:sugar/64
```
