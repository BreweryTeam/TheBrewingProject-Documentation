## Requirements

- `Java 21+`
- `PaperMC 1.21.2+` (or any compatible fork like Purpur, Folia, etc.), SpigotMC will not work

<Aside title="Performance Forks" variant="warning">
    Performance focused PaperMC forks like [Canvas](https://github.com/CraftCanvasMC/Canvas), [Leaf](https://github.com/Winds-Studio/Leaf), and [LightingLuminol](https://github.com/LuminolMC/LightingLuminol) often cause compatibility issues with plugins.
    
    Our team has already received reports of BreweryX breaking with them (see [issue #138](https://github.com/BreweryTeam/BreweryX/issues/138), [issue #85](https://github.com/BreweryTeam/BreweryX/issues/85)).
    
    While we can't guarantee that TheBrewingProject will work perfectly with these forks, its compatibility should be better than BreweryX's.
