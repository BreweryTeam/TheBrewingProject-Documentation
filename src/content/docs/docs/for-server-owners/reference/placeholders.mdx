title: "Placeholders"

TheBrewingProject supports both [PlaceholderAPI](https://github.com/PlaceholderAPI/PlaceholderAPI) and [MiniPlaceholders](https://modrinth.com/plugin/miniplaceholders) for displaying information.

Please note that some plugins don't support plugins support PlaceholderAPI, or MiniPlaceholders.  
To reliably check if a placeholder works, you can use the following commands:

```yaml
# For PlaceholderAPI
/placeholderapi parse PLAYER PLACEHOLDER

# For MiniPlaceholders
/miniplaceholders parse PLAYER PLACEHOLDER
```

## Player Placeholders
