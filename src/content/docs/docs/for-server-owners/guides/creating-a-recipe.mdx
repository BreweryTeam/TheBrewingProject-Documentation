## Creating a Recipe

In this guide, you'll learn how to create a simple or more complex recipes for TheBrewingProject.

<Aside variant="warning" title="YAML Ain't Markup Language">
Keep in mind that this guide expects you to have a basic understanding of the YAML format.
</Aside>

### Basic Properties

We'll start with the properties that every recipe should have. These are:

{/* TODO: Mention colors, minimessage */}

- `steps` - basically, the instructions for brewing your drink, more on that later.
- `potion-attributes` - properties of the final potion.
  - `name` - the name of your masterpiece.
  - `color` - the color of the potion. This can be either a color from the [`Color`](https://jd.papermc.io/paper/1.21.5/org/bukkit/Color.html) enum or a hex color code (without the `#` prefix).
  - `lore` - lore of the potion as a list of strings.
  
Let's see how this looks in practice, using vodka as an example.

{/* TODO: Link brewing, distilling tutorials when they are done */}

<Aside variant="info" title="Recipe File">
All recipes are configured in the `recipes.yml` file, located within the `/plugins/TheBrewingProject/` directory.
</Aside>

```yaml title="recipes.yml"
recipes:
    # ...
    # ... other recipes
    # ...
    vodka:
        # Previously mentioned properties
        potion-attributes:
            name: Vodka
            color: WHITE # or color: "FFFFFF"
            lore:
              - "Distilled under the light of a full moon by hushed Endermen."
        # List of steps
        steps:
            # Step 1
            # This is a `cook` step, meaning it needs a cauldron with a heat source beneath it (e.g., a fire).
            # There's also a `mix` type, which doesn't need a heat source.
          - type: cook
            # To create vodka, the cauldron must be filled with water.
            cauldron-type: water # Accepted cauldron types are `water`, `lava`, and `snow`.
            # The cooking will take 15 minutes to complete.
            cook-time: 15
            # The ingredients needed for the cooking.
            # The basic format is 'item_id/amount' for items from Minecraft.
            # For ingredients from 'ingredients.yml', use 'brewery:ingredient_id/amount'.
            # For items from other plugins, use 'plugin_name:item_id/amount' (see note below).
            ingredients:
              # We need 10 potatoes
              - Potato/10
            # Step 2, which is a `distill` step.
          - type: distill
            # Distill 3 times.
            runs: 3
```

<Aside variant="info" title="Item Integrations">
You can check out the [Integrations](../reference/integrations) page to see which plugins are supported for items in recipes.
</Aside>

And there you have it! You have created your first recipe. You can simulate the creation process by using the `/tbp create` command. In this case, you would use:
```mcfunction
/tbp create cook 15 water "Potato/10" distill 3
```

{/* TODO: Link command reference when it's complete */}

Here's how the vodka appears in-game based on the recipe's accuracy:

| Steps | Quality | Preview |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 10 Potatoes, Cook for 15 minutes, Distill 3 times     | Excellent    | ![](@/assets/docs/for-server-owners/guides/creating-a-recipe/vodka-1-excellent.png) |
| 7 Potatoes, Cook for 15 minutes, Distill 5 times     | Good    | ![](@/assets/docs/for-server-owners/guides/creating-a-recipe/vodka-1-good.png) |
| 25 Potatoes, Cook for 25 minutes, Distill 1 time    | Bad    | ![](@/assets/docs/for-server-owners/guides/creating-a-recipe/vodka-1-bad.png) |

Why am I showing you all three variants, when they all look the same?
That's because we'll introduce quality factored properties, and you'll notice that the quality of the brew will affect the potion's appearance.

### Quality Factored Propertiess

**Quality Factored Properties** allow you to define values or behaviors that adapt based on the achieved quality of the brew (Bad, Good or Excellent).  
This makes searching for the perfect brew more rewarding by enabling higher quality brews to deliver better or unique effects.

##### Quality Factored List

A **Quality Factored List** lets you control which items are included in a list based on the brew's final quality. This is particularly useful for:

- Names
- Lores
- Potion effects

You define which items apply to which quality by prefixing them with `+` symbols. Here's how it works:

| Prefix | Applies To Quality | Description                                                                 |
|--------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `+++`  | Excellent only     | The item is included *only* if the brew is of Excellent quality.            |
| `++`   | Good only          | The item is included *only* if the brew is of Good quality.                 |
| `+`    | Bad only           | The item is included *only* if the brew is of Bad quality.                  |
| (none) | All Qualities      | The item is included regardless of the brew's quality (the default).        |
