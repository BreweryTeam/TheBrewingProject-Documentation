In this guide, you'll learn how to create a simple or more complex recipes for TheBrewingProject.

<Aside variant="warning" title="YAML Ain't Markup Language">
  Keep in mind that this guide expects you to have a basic understanding of the YAML
  format.

TODO: Move this to a better place:  
The recipes in TheBrewingProject are stored in `/plugins/TheBrewingProject/recipes.yml` file, and are written in YAML format.

## Fundamental concepts

### Quality Factored Properties

**Quality Factored Properties** allow you to define values or behaviors that adapt based on the achieved quality of the brew (Bad, Good or Excellent).  
This makes searching for the perfect brew more rewarding as you can make the higher quality brews deliver better results or unique effects.

##### Quality Factored List

A **Quality Factored List** lets you control which items are included in a list based on the brew's final quality. This is particularly useful for **Lores** and **Potion Effects**.

You define which items apply to which quality by prefixing them with `+` symbols. Here's how it works:

| Prefix | Applies To Quality | Description                                                          |
| ------ | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `+++`  | Excellent only     | The item is included _only_ if the brew is of Excellent quality.     |
| `++`   | Good only          | The item is included _only_ if the brew is of Good quality.          |
| `+`    | Bad only           | The item is included _only_ if the brew is of Bad quality.           |
| (none) | All Qualities      | The item is included regardless of the brew's quality (the default). |

##### Example

```yaml
lore:
  - +++ A rare, top-shelf beer, perfect for connoisseurs.
  - ++ A decent brew, great for relaxing after a hard day's work.
  - + A cloudy, sluggish mixture. It'll teach you a lesson about cutting corners when brewing.
  - This message is always included, regardless of quality.
```

#### Quality Factored Value

We can also make a single value to change with quality (name, message, alcohol level, etc.).  
To do that provide three options separated by `/`: `Bad/Good/Excellent`.

##### Example

```yaml
name: Skunked Beer/Beer/Golden Lager
```

### Ingredients

An ingredient can be an item from Minecraft, an item from another plugin, or another brew.  
See the [Integrations](/docs/for-server-owners/reference/integrations) page for a list of supported plugins.

Ingredients are defined in the `ingredients` property of a recipe, and can be specified in the following formats, depending on what you want to do:

| Format                             | Description                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `<item_id>/<amount>`               | A Minecraft item.            |
| `<plugin_name>:<item_id>/<amount>` | An item from another plugin. |
| `brewery:<brew_id>/<amount>`       | Another brew.                |

Example:

```yaml
ingredients:
  - emerald/5 # 5 Emeralds.
  - nexo:infused_golden_apple/2 # 2 Infused Golden Apples from the Nexo plugin.
  - brewery:beer/1 # 1 Beer from TheBrewingProject.
```

### MiniMessage

Every message or text in the recipe configuration is going to be formatted using MiniMessage.  
**There's no support for legacy formatting codes!**

Here's a quick comparison of how MiniMessage looks compared to legacy formatting:

| Format              | Message                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Legacy              | `&2&lTest&r&#2080ff123`                     |
| MiniMessage         | `<dark_green><bold>Test<reset><#2080ff>123` |
| MiniMessage (short) | `<dark_green><b>Test<r><#2080ff>123`        |

For more information on how to use MiniMessage, check out the [MiniMessage Format](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format) page.

## Recipe Structure

A TheBrewingProject recipe is a YAML object that contains the following properties (see below for more details):

| Property                                  | Description                                                                                                                                               | Required |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| [`steps`](#steps)                         | The instructions for brewing your drink.                                                                                                                  | **Yes**  |
| [`potion-attributes`](#potion-attributes) | Properties of the final brew.                                                                                                                             | **Yes**  |
| [`brew-difficulty`](#brew-difficulty)     | How hard it should be to make the brew.                                                                                                                   | No       |
| [`alcohol`](#alcohol)                     | The alcohol content of the brew. The value can be anything, but will realistically be truncated between -100 and 100. _This is a Quality Factored Value._ | No       |
| [`effects`](#effects)                     | Potion effects that the brew will apply to the player when consumed.                                                                                      | No       |
| [`messages`](#messages)                   | Messages that can be displayed after the player drinks the brew.                                                                                          | No       |

### `steps` - TO REVIEW

The `steps` property is a list of steps that the player must follow to create the brew.

Each step has a `type`, which can be either `cook`, `mix`, `distill` or `age`.

A recipe can't include both `cook` and `mix` steps. This means a typical recipe will follow one of these two paths:

```d2 sketch pad=50 animated
direction: down

# Cook
cook: Cook
distill_cook_path: Distill
age_cook_path: Age

cook -> distill_cook_path { style.animated: true }
distill_cook_path -> age_cook_path { style.animated: true }
cook -> age_cook_path { style.animated: true }

# Mix
mix: Mix
distill_mix_path: Distill
age_mix_path: Age

mix -> distill_mix_path { style.animated: true }
distill_mix_path -> age_mix_path { style.animated: true }
mix -> age_mix_path { style.animated: true }
```

#### The `cook` Step

The `cook` step requires a heat source underneath a cauldron, such as a furnace or a campfire.

It has 2 mandatory properties: `ingredients` and `cook-time`,  
and one optional property: `cauldron-type`.

```yaml
- type: cook
  # Accepted cauldron types are `water`, `lava`, and `snow`.
  # If not specified, it defaults to `water`.
  cauldron-type: water

  # How long the cooking will take, in minutes.
  cook-time: 15

  # The ingredients needed for the cook step.
  ingredients:
    - Potato/10 # 10 Potatoes
    - nexo:pomegranate/5 # 5 Pomegranates from the Nexo plugin
```

#### The `mix` Step

The `mix` step works similarly to the `cook` step, but it doesn't require a cauldron or a heat source.

It has 2 mandatory properties: `ingredients` and `mix-time`.

```yaml
- type: mix
  # How long the mixing will take, in minutes.
  mix-time: 5

  # The ingredients needed for the brew.
  ingredients:
    - Apple/3 # 3 Apples
```

#### The `distill` Step

Useful step for many recipes, although not required, [happens in a distillery](/docs/for-players/guides/distilling)

It has 1 mandatory property: `runs`.

```yaml
- type: distill

  # How many times the brew needs to be distilled.
  runs: 3
```

#### The `age` Step

The `age` step means the recipe needs to be aged in a barrel.

It has 2 mandatory properties: `barrel-type` and `age-years`.

```yaml
- type: age

  # The type of barrel to use for aging.
  # Includes copper and all the wood types.
  barrel-type: oak

  # How long the aging will take, in game days.
  age-years: 2
```

### `potion-attributes` - WAITING ON MERGE

> Waiting on [expressive-code#add-annotation-comments](https://github.com/expressive-code/expressive-code/tree/add-annotation-comments) to get merged üôè.

Potion attributes basically define the actual potion item that will be created as the output of a recipe.

Available properties are:

- `name` - the name of your masterpiece. <Badge text="Quality Factored Value" variant="tip" />
- `color` - the color of the potion. This can be either a color from the [`Color`](https://jd.papermc.io/paper/1.21.5/org/bukkit/Color.html) enum or a hex color code (without the `#` prefix).
- `lore` - lore of the brew as a list of strings. <Badge text="Quality Factored List" variant="tip" />
- `glint` - whether to apply a glint effect to the potion item. Default to `false`. <Badge text="Optional" variant="tip" />
- `append-brew-info-lore` - you can decide whether the extra lore should be displayed for an item, this includes for example recipe hints such as cook time, and so on. <Badge text="Optional" variant="tip" />
- `custom-id` - You can tag the brew to be made to a custom item with the following tag. Currently no checks are done on enable for this, please test each item for now when doing this. <Badge text="Optional" variant="tip" />

#### Model attributes

Model attributes let you customize how your potion item appears in-game.  
Particularly useful with custom resource packs.

- `item-model` - Allows to define custom models. <Badge text="Optional" variant="tip" />
- `custom-model-data` - The old way of defining custom models. **Not recommended on 1.21.4+** <Badge text="Optional" variant="tip" />

If you want to use custom models, you can learn more about them here:

[New format (item-model)](https://github.com/Simplexity-Development/Custom_Model_Data_Guide)  
[Old format (custom-model-data)](https://github.com/Simplexity-Development/Custom_Model_Data_Guide/tree/26b269ffa0f4a99646f4969de7a2880ae4f677a3)

You can also use Minecraft's models, here's how a beer with `item-model: minecraft:grass_block` will look in-game:

<Image
  src={customModelImage}
  alt="Image showing how a beer with item-model: minecraft:grass_block will look in-game"
/>

### `alcohol` - TODO

Exactly what it sounds like, the alcohol content of the brew.

Positive values are for alcoholic brews, while negative values can decrease player's drunkenness (-100 to 100).

### `brew-difficulty` - TODO

Define how hard it should be to brew a beverage.

### `effects` - TODO

### `messages` - TO REVIEW

Used for specifying messages (action bar, title or chat messages) that will be displayed to the player after they drink the brew.  
You can define each message as a Quality Factored Value or a simple string.

```yaml
messages:
  # action bar message
  action-bar: Bad action bar message/Good one/Excellent one

  # title
  title: A title

  # chat message
  message: <gold>Look, MiniMessage!
```

Here's how the example above looks in the game (excellent quality brew):
