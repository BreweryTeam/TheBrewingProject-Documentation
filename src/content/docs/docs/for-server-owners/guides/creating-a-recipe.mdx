## Creating a Recipe

In this guide, you'll learn how to create a simple or more complex recipes for TheBrewingProject.

<Aside variant="warning" title="YAML Ain't Markup Language">
Keep in mind that this guide expects you to have a basic understanding of the YAML format.

## Fundamental concepts

### Quality Factored Propertiess

**Quality Factored Properties** allow you to define values or behaviors that adapt based on the achieved quality of the brew (Bad, Good or Excellent).  
This makes searching for the perfect brew more rewarding as you can make the higher quality brews deliver better results or unique effects.

##### Quality Factored List

A **Quality Factored List** lets you control which items are included in a list based on the brew's final quality. This is particularly useful for **Lores** and **Potion Effects**.

You define which items apply to which quality by prefixing them with `+` symbols. Here's how it works:

| Prefix | Applies To Quality | Description                                                                 |
|--------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `+++`  | Excellent only     | The item is included *only* if the brew is of Excellent quality.            |
| `++`   | Good only          | The item is included *only* if the brew is of Good quality.                 |
| `+`    | Bad only           | The item is included *only* if the brew is of Bad quality.                  |
| (none) | All Qualities      | The item is included regardless of the brew's quality (the default).        |

##### Example

```yaml
lore:
  - +++ A rare, top-shelf beer, perfect for connoisseurs.
  - ++ A decent brew, great for relaxing after a hard day's work.
  - + A cloudy, sluggish mixture. It'll teach you a lesson about cutting corners when brewing.
  - This message is always included, regardless of quality.
```

#### Quality Factored Value

{/* TODO: Put this in Reference */}
We can also make a single value to change with quality (name, message, alcohol level, etc.).  
To do that provide three options separated by `/`: `Bad/Good/Excellent`.

##### Example

```yaml
name: Skunked Beer/Beer/Golden Lager
```

### ingredients

{/* TODO */}

### MiniMessage

Every message or text in the recipe configuration is going to be formatted using MiniMessage.  
There's no support for legacy formatting codes (e.g. `&a`).

For more information on how to use MiniMessage, check out the [MiniMessage Format](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format) page.

## An example Vodka recipe

We'll start with the properties that every recipe should have. These are:

{/* TODO: Mention colors, minimessage */}

- `steps` - basically, the instructions for brewing your drink, see below.
- `potion-attributes` - properties of the final potion.
  - `name` - the name of your masterpiece. <Badge text="Quality Factored Value" variant="note" />
  - `color` - the color of the potion. This can be either a color from the [`Color`](https://jd.papermc.io/paper/1.21.5/org/bukkit/Color.html) enum or a hex color code (without the `#` prefix).
  - `lore` - lore of the potion as a list of strings. <Badge text="Quality Factored List" variant="note" />
- `alcohol` - the alcohol content of the potion. The value can be anything, but will realistically be trunkated between -100 and 100. <Badge text="Quality Factored Value" variant="note" />

### `steps`

The `steps` property is a list of steps that the player must follow to create the potion.

Each step has a `type`, which can be either `cook`, `mix`, `distill` or `age`.  

A recipe can't include both `cook` and `mix` steps. This means a typical recipe will follow one of these two paths:

```d2 sketch pad=50 animated
direction: down

# Cook
distill_cook_path: Distill
age_cook_path: Age

cook -> distill_cook_path { style.animated: true }
distill_cook_path -> age_cook_path { style.animated: true }
cook -> age_cook_path { style.animated: true }

# Distill
distill_mix_path: Distill
age_mix_path: Age

mix -> distill_mix_path { style.animated: true }
distill_mix_path -> age_mix_path { style.animated: true }
mix -> age_mix_path { style.animated: true }
```

#### `cook` Step

A `cook` step requires a cauldron with a heat source beneath it (e.g., a fire).  
It has 2 mandatory properties: `ingredients` and `cook-time`, and one optional property: `cauldron-type` (water by default).
The `cauldron-type` can be one of the following: `water`, `lava`, or `snow`.

Let's see how this looks in practice, using vodka as an example.

<Aside variant="info" title="Recipe File">
All recipes are configured in the `recipes.yml` file, located within the `/plugins/TheBrewingProject/` directory.
</Aside>

```yaml title="recipes.yml"
recipes:
    # ...
    # ... other recipes
    # ...
    vodka:
        # Previously mentioned properties
        potion-attributes:
            name: Vodka
            color: WHITE # or color: "FFFFFF"
            lore:
              - "Distilled under the light of a full moon by hushed Endermen."
        # 40ml alcohol, TODO: Ask Thorin if it's % or ml or something else (or just 40).
        alcohol: 40
        # List of steps
        steps:
            # Step 1
            # This is a `cook` step, meaning it needs a cauldron with a heat source beneath it (e.g., a fire).
            # There's also a `mix` type, which doesn't need a heat source.
          - type: cook
            # To create vodka, the cauldron must be filled with water.
            cauldron-type: water # Accepted cauldron types are `water`, `lava`, and `snow`.
            # The cooking will take 15 minutes to complete.
            cook-time: 15
            # The ingredients needed for the cooking.
            # The basic format is 'item_id/amount' for items from Minecraft.
            # For ingredients from 'ingredients.yml', use 'brewery:ingredient_id/amount'.
            # For items from other plugins, use 'plugin_name:item_id/amount' (see note below).
            ingredients:
              # We need 10 potatoes
              - Potato/10
            # Step 2, which is a `distill` step.
          - type: distill
            # Distill 3 times.
            runs: 3
```

<Aside variant="info" title="Item Integrations">
You can check out the [Integrations](../reference/integrations) page to see which plugins are supported for items in recipes.
</Aside>

And there you have it! You have created your first recipe. You can simulate the creation process by using the `/tbp create` command. In this case, you would use:
```mcfunction
/tbp create cook 15 water "Potato/10" distill 3
```

{/* TODO: Link command reference when it's complete */}

Here's how the vodka appears in-game based on the recipe's accuracy:

| Steps | Quality | Preview |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 10 Potatoes, Cook for 15 minutes, Distill 3 times     | Excellent    | ![](@/assets/docs/for-server-owners/guides/creating-a-recipe/vodka-1-excellent.png) |
| 7 Potatoes, Cook for 15 minutes, Distill 5 times     | Good    | ![](@/assets/docs/for-server-owners/guides/creating-a-recipe/vodka-1-good.png) |
| 25 Potatoes, Cook for 25 minutes, Distill 1 time    | Bad    | ![](@/assets/docs/for-server-owners/guides/creating-a-recipe/vodka-1-bad.png) |

Why am I showing you all three variants, when they all look the same?
That's because we'll introduce quality factored properties mentioned earlier, and you'll see how much difference they make.

#### Quality Factored Properties Example

Let's enhance our vodka recipe with quality factored properties:

```yaml title="recipes.yml"
recipes:
    # ...
    vodka:
        potion-attributes:
            # quality factored name
            name: Poor Vodka/Vodka/Russian Vodka
            color: WHITE
            # quality factored lore
            lore:
              - + A cheap drink, best avoided if you value your taste buds.
              - ++ A decent drink, good for a casual evening.
              - +++ Strong enough to warm a Siberian winter.
        alcohol: 25/32/40
        steps:
          - type: cook
            cauldron-type: water
            cook-time: 15
            ingredients:
              - Potato/10
          - type: distill
            runs: 3
```
