## Creating a Recipe

In this guide, you'll learn how to create a simple or more complex recipes for TheBrewingProject.

<Aside variant="warning" title="YAML Ain't Markup Language">
Keep in mind that this guide expects you to have a basic understanding of the YAML format.
</Aside>

### Basic Properties

We'll start with the properties that every recipe should have. These are:

- `steps` - basically, the instructions for brewing your drink, more on that later.
- `potion-attributes` - properties of the final potion.
  - `name` - the name of your masterpiece.
  - `color` - the color of the potion. This can be either a color from the [`Color`](https://jd.papermc.io/paper/1.21.5/org/bukkit/Color.html) enum or a hex color code (without the `#` prefix).

Let's see how this looks in practice, using vodka as an example.

<Aside variant="info" title="Recipe File">
All recipes are configured in the `recipes.yml` file, located within the `/plugins/TheBrewingProject/` directory.
</Aside>

```yaml title="recipes.yml"
recipes:
    # ...
    # ... other recipes
    # ...
    vodka:
        # Previously mentioned properties
        potion-attributes:
            name: Vodka
            color: WHITE # or color: "FFFFFF"
        # List of steps
        steps:
            # Step 1
            # This is a `cook` step, meaning it needs a cauldron with a heat source beneath it (e.g., a fire).
            # There's also a `mix` type, which doesn't need a heat source.
          - type: cook
            # To create vodka, the cauldron must be filled with water.
            cauldron-type: water # Accepted cauldron types are `water`, `lava`, and `snow`.
            # The cooking will take 15 minutes to complete.
            cook-time: 15
            # The ingredients needed for the cooking.
            # The basic format is 'item_id/amount' for items from Minecraft.
            # For ingredients from 'ingredients.yml', use 'brewery:ingredient_id/amount'.
            # For items from other plugins, use 'plugin_name:item_id/amount' (see note below).
            ingredients:
              # We need 10 potatoes
              - Potato/10
            # Step 2, which is a `distill` step.
          - type: distill
            # Distill 3 times.
            runs: 3
```

<Aside variant="info" title="Item Integrations">
You can check out the [Integrations](/docs/for-server-owners/reference/integrations) page to see which plugins are supported for items in recipes.
</Aside>

And there you have it! You have created your first recipe. You can simulate the creation process by using the `/tbp create` command. In this case, you would use:
```mcfunction
/tbp create cook 15 water "Potato/10" distill 3
```

### Advanced Properties & Effects

So, right now our recipe is pretty basic and doesn't do anything, to make the players want to brew it, we can add, well... alcohol, and some effects.

To do that, we can use the `alcohol` and `effects` properties. These are not required, but unless you use `events`, they are pretty much mandatory for any recipe that you want to be worth brewing.

```yaml title="recipes.yml"
recipes:
    # ...
    vodka:
        # Collapsed
        potion-attributes:
            # ...
        steps:
            # ...
        # The alcohol content of the brew
        # Can be anything, but will realistically be trunkated between -100 and 100.
        alcohol: 40
        # The effects that the potion will give to the player.
        effects:
          # TODO: Check if this is in ticks or seconds, the hangar wiki says ticks, but it seems too short.
          # The weakness effect, which will last for 15 seconds with a level of 1.
          - WEAKNESS/15
          # The poison effect, which will last for 10 seconds with a level of 2.
            POISON/10/2
          # I have no idea
          - SLOWNESS/0-1/30-50
```
