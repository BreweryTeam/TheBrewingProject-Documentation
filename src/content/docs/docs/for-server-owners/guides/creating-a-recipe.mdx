TODO: Move this to a better place:  
The recipes in TheBrewingProject are stored in `/plugins/TheBrewingProject/recipes.yml` file, and are written in YAML format.

## Fundamental concepts

### The Quality System

TheBrewingProject features a quality system where every brew can turn out **Bad**, **Good**, or **Excellent**.  
This makes the brewing process more engaging and rewarding for players.

Quality Factored Properties are configuration options that allow you to define values or behaviors that change based on the final quality of the brew.

#### Quality Factored Value

A Quality Factored Value allows a single property, such as an item's name or a brew's alcohol content, to change depending on the quality.  
You define this by providing three values separated by slashes in the format: `Bad/Good/Excellent`.

##### Example

```yaml
name: Skunked Beer/<gold>Beer/<gradient:#ff8412:#ffdf29><b>Golden Lager
```

| Quality   | Resulting Name                                        |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Excellent | <Image src={beerNameExcellent} alt="Golden Langer" /> |
| Good      | <Image src={beerNameGood} alt="Beer" />               |
| Bad       | <Image src={beerNameBad} alt="Skunked Beer" />        |

##### Quality Factored List

A Quality Factored List allows you to conditionally include items in a list, such as lore lines or potion effects, based on the brew's quality.

You control this by prefixing list items with `+` symbols.

| Prefix | Applies To Quality | Description                                                          |
| ------ | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `+++`  | Excellent only     | The item is included _only_ if the brew is of Excellent quality.     |
| `++`   | Good only          | The item is included _only_ if the brew is of Good quality.          |
| `+`    | Bad only           | The item is included _only_ if the brew is of Bad quality.           |
| (none) | All Qualities      | The item is included regardless of the brew's quality (the default). |

##### Example

```yaml
lore:
  - +++ <gold>A rare, top-shelf beer, perfect for connoisseurs.
  - ++ <yellow>A decent brew, great for relaxing after a hard day's work.
  - + <gray>A cloudy, sluggish mixture.
  - <italic>This message is always included, regardless of quality.
```

### Ingredients

Ingredients are the building blocks of your recipes. An ingredient can be a vanilla Minecraft item, an item from another supported plugin, or even another brew created with TheBrewingProject.

Ingredients are defined as a list under the `ingredients` key in a brewing step. The format for defining an ingredient depends on the type of item:

| Format                             | Description                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<item_id>/<amount>`               | A Minecraft item.                                                                                     |
| `<plugin_name>:<item_id>/<amount>` | An item from another plugin. See [Integrations](/docs/for-server-owners/reference/integrations) page. |
| `brewery:<brew_id>/<amount>`       | Another brew from TheBrewingProject.                                                                  |

Example:

```yaml
ingredients:
  - emerald/5 # 5 Emeralds.
  - nexo:infused_golden_apple/2 # 2 Infused Golden Apples from the Nexo plugin.
  - brewery:beer/1 # 1 Beer from TheBrewingProject.
```

### MiniMessage Formatting

Every message or text in the recipe configuration is going to be formatted using MiniMessage.  
**Legacy formatting codes (e.g., &a, &l) are not supported.**

| Format                 | Message                                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Legacy (Not Supported) | `&2&lTest&r&#2080ff123`                     |
| MiniMessage            | `<dark_green><bold>Test<reset><#2080ff>123` |
| MiniMessage (short)    | `<dark_green><b>Test<r><#2080ff>123`        |

For a complete guide on syntax and features, please refer to the official [MiniMessage Format Documentation](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format).

## Recipe Structure

Recipes are defined as entries in the `recipes.yml` file. Each recipe has an id and a set of properties that define its final product and the process to create it.

| Property                                  | Description                                                                                                                                               | Required |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| [`steps`](#steps)                         | The instructions for brewing your drink.                                                                                                                  | **Yes**  |
| [`potion-attributes`](#potion-attributes) | Defines the appearance and metadata of the final potion item.                                                                                             | **Yes**  |
| [`brew-difficulty`](#brew-difficulty)     | How hard it should be to make the brew.                                                                                                                   | No       |
| [`alcohol`](#alcohol)                     | The alcohol content of the brew. The value can be anything, but will realistically be truncated between -100 and 100. _This is a Quality Factored Value._ | No       |
| [`effects`](#effects)                     | Potion effects applied to the player after drinking the brew.                                                                                               | No       |
| [`messages`](#messages)                   | Messages that can be displayed after the player drinks the brew.                                                                                          | No       |

### `potion-attributes`

Potion attributes basically define the actual potion item that will be created as the output of a recipe.

<PotionAttributesConfig client:only="react" />

#### Custom models

Custom models will be in a separate tutorial, which more in-depth explanation.

### `steps` - TO REVIEW

The `steps` property is a list of steps that the player must follow to create the brew.

The available step types are `cook`, `mix`, `distill`, and `age`.

While steps can be defined in any order, the logical flow of brewing must be respected.  
Cooking and mixing must happen first in a cauldron. Once the brew is removed from the cauldron (by bottling it), it can be distilled or aged, but not cooked or mixed again.

The recommended and the BreweryX order is: cook/mix -> distill -> age.

```d2 sketch pad=50 animated
direction: down

cook: Cook (in a Cauldron)
mix: Mix (in a Cauldron)
distill: Distill (in a Distillery)
age: Age (in a Barrel)

cook -> distill
mix -> distill
distill -> age
```

#### The `cook` Step

The `cook` step requires a heat source underneath a cauldron, such as a furnace or a campfire.

- `ingredients`: **(Required)** A list of ingredients that are needed for the cooking step.
- `cook-time`: **(Required)** The required cooking duration in minutes.
- `cauldron-type`: (Optional) The type of liquid required in the cauldron. Can be `water`, `lava`, or `snow`. Defaults to `water`.

```yaml
- type: cook
  cauldron-type: water
  cook-time: 15
  ingredients:
    - potato/10
    - nexo:pomegranate/5
```

#### The `mix` Step

The `mix` step is similar to `cook` but does not require a heat source, and does not have a `cauldron-type` property.

- `ingredients`: **(Required)** A list of ingredients that are needed for the mixing step.
- `mix-time`: **(Required)** The required mixing duration in minutes.

```yaml
- type: mix
  mix-time: 5
  ingredients:
    - apple/3
    - sugar_cane/8
```

#### The `distill` Step

Useful step for many recipes, although not required, [happens in a distillery](/docs/for-players/guides/distilling)

- `runs`: *(Required)** The number of times the brew must be distilled.

```yaml
- type: distill
  runs: 3
```

#### The `age` Step

The `age` step requires the brew to be placed in a barrel for a specific duration.

- `barrel-type`: **(Required)** The type of wood for the barrel. Accepts all vanilla wood types (e.g., oak, spruce, birch, acacia, etc.) and copper.
- `age-years`: **(Required)** The aging duration in TheBrewingProject years, which can be configured in the plugin's settings.  
  The default is 24000 ticks, which is equivalent to 1 Minecraft day. TODO: Link to config page.

```yaml
- type: age

  # The type of barrel to use for aging.
  # Includes copper and all the wood types.
  barrel-type: oak

  # How long the aging will take, in game days.
  age-years: 2
```

### `alcohol` - TODO

Exactly what it sounds like, the alcohol content of the brew.

Positive values are for alcoholic brews, while negative values can decrease player's drunkenness (-100 to 100).

### `brew-difficulty` - TODO

Define how hard it should be to brew a beverage.

### `effects` - TODO

### `messages` - TO REVIEW

Used for specifying messages (action bar, title or chat messages) that will be displayed to the player after they drink the brew.  
You can define each message as a Quality Factored Value or a simple string.

```yaml
messages:
  # action bar message
  action-bar: Bad action bar message/Good one/Excellent one

  # title
  title: A title

  # chat message
  message: <gold>Look, MiniMessage!
```

Here's how the example above looks in the game (excellent quality brew):
