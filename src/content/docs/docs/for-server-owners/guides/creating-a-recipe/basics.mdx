## Basics

### The Quality System

TheBrewingProject features a quality system where every brew can turn out **Bad**, **Good**, or **Excellent**.  
This makes the brewing process more engaging and rewarding for players.

Quality Factored Properties are configuration options that allow you to define values or behaviors that change based on the final quality of the brew.

#### Quality Factored Value

A Quality Factored Value allows a single property, such as an item's name or a brew's alcohol content, to change depending on the quality.  
You define this by providing three values separated by slashes in the format: `Bad/Good/Excellent`.

##### Example

```yaml
name: Skunked Beer/<gold>Beer/<gradient:#ff8412:#ffdf29><b>Golden Lager
```

| Quality   | Resulting Name                                        |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Excellent | <Image src={beerNameExcellent} alt="Golden Langer" /> |
| Good      | <Image src={beerNameGood} alt="Beer" />               |
| Bad       | <Image src={beerNameBad} alt="Skunked Beer" />        |

##### Quality Factored List

A Quality Factored List allows you to conditionally include items in a list, such as lore lines or potion effects, based on the brew's quality.

You control this by prefixing list items with `+` symbols.

| Prefix | Applies To Quality | Description                                                          |
| ------ | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `+++`  | Excellent only     | The item is included _only_ if the brew is of Excellent quality.     |
| `++`   | Good only          | The item is included _only_ if the brew is of Good quality.          |
| `+`    | Bad only           | The item is included _only_ if the brew is of Bad quality.           |
| (none) | All Qualities      | The item is included regardless of the brew's quality (the default). |

##### Example

```yaml
lore:
  - +++ <gold>A rare, top-shelf beer, perfect for connoisseurs.
  - ++ <yellow>A decent brew, great for relaxing after a hard day's work.
  - + <gray>A cloudy, sluggish mixture.
  - <italic>This message is always included, regardless of quality.
```

### Ingredients

Ingredients are the building blocks of your recipes. An ingredient can be a vanilla Minecraft item, an item from another supported plugin, or even another brew created with TheBrewingProject.

Ingredients are defined as a list under the `ingredients` key in a brewing step. The format for defining an ingredient depends on the type of item:

| Format                             | Description                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<item_id>/<amount>`               | A Minecraft item.                                                                                     |
| `<plugin_name>:<item_id>/<amount>` | An item from another plugin. See [Integrations](/docs/for-server-owners/reference/integrations) page. |
| `brewery:<brew_id>/<amount>`       | Another brew from TheBrewingProject.                                                                  |

Example:

```yaml
ingredients:
  - emerald/5 # 5 Emeralds.
  - nexo:infused_golden_apple/2 # 2 Infused Golden Apples from the Nexo plugin.
  - brewery:beer/1 # 1 Beer from TheBrewingProject.
```

### MiniMessage Formatting

Every message or text in the recipe configuration is going to be formatted using MiniMessage.  
**Legacy formatting codes (e.g., &a, §l) are not supported.**

| Format                 | Message                                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Legacy (Not Supported) | `&2&lTest&r&#2080ff123`                     |
| MiniMessage            | `<dark_green><bold>Test<reset><#2080ff>123` |
| MiniMessage - short    | `<dark_green><b>Test<r><#2080ff>123`        |

For a complete guide on syntax and features, please refer to the official [MiniMessage Format Documentation](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format).
