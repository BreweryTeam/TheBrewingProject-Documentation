Modifiers are time-based stats that describe a player's current state (e.g. alcohol, alcohol addiction, toxins). They can be changed by consuming brews or configured consumables (milk, for example). 

Modifiers have the following properties:
| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `name`| The name of the modifier (which also acts as an ID) |
